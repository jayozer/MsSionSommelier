As a result, gradient clips and this clipping limits the maximum value of gradients at every node. This sounds a lot like compressing audio and how hard clipping can create distortion thus introduce noise."

I think it is possible to set epoch to a bit larger and then watch loss to see if dimishing rate of return has been reached. Regardless I completed a 20 epoch run for this data. I wonder at what loss I am going to be able to achieve coherence. With one epoch the results are abismal and as the 20 epochs were running all I could think was how the results were gonna come out. Even with a c518Xlarge machine and with 3.7% of overall corpus, training took over 3 hrs. Another tip here is to note that larger machines add up quickly as cost, it is easy to pass the allowance you initially set in mind. But we adapt."
